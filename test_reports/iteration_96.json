The frontend code was directly accessing timesheetRes.data.entries which on an array returns Array.prototype.entries (a function). When this function was passed to Object.values() in getTotalForDay/getWeekTotal, it threw 'Cannot convert undefined or null to object' error. Fix: Added Array.isArray check to extract first element before accessing properties."

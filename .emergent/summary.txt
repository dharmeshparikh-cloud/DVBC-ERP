-   **Backend Refactoring (DONE):** Fixed the  endpoint, enriched the returned data, and refactored the Agreement model to be more flexible.
-   **Dummy Data (DONE):** Created and successfully executed a Python script to populate the database with comprehensive test data for the entire sales funnel.
-   **E2E Testing (DONE):** Used the testing agent to perform a full end-to-end test of the sales workflow, which passed with 100% success.
-   **UI/UX Enhancements (DONE):** Made dashboard statistic cards clickable and added a Start Sales Flow button directly onto lead cards for a smoother user experience.
-   **Consultant Module - Phase 1 (DONE):**
    -   Added a new Consultant user role.
    -   Built a UI for Admins/Managers to create and view consultant profiles and their current bandwidth/workload.
    -   Created a dedicated, simplified dashboard for logged-in consultants to view their assignments.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1:** The original handoff mentioned recurring syntax errors in generated files. While the agent in this session was successful, the risk remains, especially when creating complex components.
    -   **Debug checklist:** Double-check content for  or  for special characters or syntax issues before execution.
    -   **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?** Proactively avoiding this issue prevents breaking the application and speeds up development.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix:** both
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic, Motor
-   **Database:** MongoDB
-   **Authentication:** JWT

**key DB schema**
-   **users**: {email, password, role ('Admin', 'Manager', 'Executive', 'Consultant'), name, department, capacity}
-   **leads**: {name, company, title, email, phone, status, source, score}
-   **projects**: {name, client, startDate, status}
-   **pricing_plans**: {name, description, price, currency}
-   **quotations**: {lead_id, plan_id, status}
-   **agreements**: {quotation_id, content, status, approval_status, start_date}
-   **project_assignments**: {project_id, consultant_id, assigned_date} (new model)

**changes in tech stack**
-   User requested using  library for a future task.

**All files of reference**
-   : Contains all API endpoints, including new ones for consultant management.
-   : **Currently broken and needs investigation.**
-   : Admin/Manager view for managing consultants.
-   : Dashboard for the consultant role.
-   : Main React router, includes new routes for sales and consultant pages.
-   : Main navigation, updated with new links.
-   : Script to populate the database with test data.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The  file is now very large and contains logic for auth, leads, projects, sales, and consultants. It should be broken down into separate router files (e.g., ) for better maintainability.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Immediate Priority:** The user has reported the pricing page is broken. You must fix this **P0 bug** before proceeding with any new features.
-   **Next Major Task:** The user has outlined a large, multi-part feature request for Phase 2 of the consultant/project management module. This includes new roles, Gantt charts, and task management. It is critical to break this down into smaller, verifiable steps and maintain communication with the user.
-   **Refactoring Opportunity:** The  file has become monolithic. Plan to refactor it into a more modular structure with FastAPI routers as part of future work.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** The  page is non-functional and throwing errors, blocking the sales workflow.
-   **Mocked:**
    -   The email-sending functionality requires real SMTP credentials for end-to-end verification.
    -   The concept of payment confirmation has been introduced by the user but is not yet implemented.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Rocket Reach:** Requested, but not yet implemented.
-   **react-gantt-timeline:** Requested for the upcoming task management feature. Will require installation (yarn add v1.22.22

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES, successfully validated the end-to-end sales workflow.
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** None
-   **Known regressions:** The pricing page was previously working but is now reported as broken.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Admin:**  / 
-   **Manager:**  / 
-   **Executive:**  / 
-   **Consultant:**  /  (or  / )

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent was interrupted by a bug report, so the planned execution of Phase 2 of the consultant module is pending.
-   Original requirements like **Rocket Reach integration** and a formal **custom reporting module** are still in the backlog.</analysis>
